# Evolving-ANN-Encoding
Repo for scratch work that will eventually be integrated into Cloann.

## What is in the repo?
I have designed an encoding for artificial neural network topologies that can be fed into Cloann and used alongside a dataset to train an artificial neural network.
The code in this repo is a place to store my Push instructions for creating encoded topologies until Cloann is ready to be fully integrated with Clojush.

## Usage
Evaluate the code in core.clj and the output should be a random netowrk encoding!
